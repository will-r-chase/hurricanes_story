    <h3>What’s in a name?</h3>
    <p>
      In 1954, three devastating hurricanes struck the United States. Hurricane
      names typically repeat, but the following year those hurricane
      names—Carol, Edna, and Hazel—were retired, not to be used again out of
      respect for the victims. The practice of naming hurricanes after people
      had only been formally adopted in 1950. Prior to that, hurricanes were
      often named after places or the name of the Saint’s Day on which the
      hurricane occurred. Beginning in 1944, meteorologists from the US armed
      forces began informally naming hurricanes after their wives and
      girlfriends, finding that the colloquial names improved recall and helped
      avoid confusion between multiple storms. In 1945 they publicly adopted a
      list of women’s names to be used for naming Pacific hurricanes, and
      requested that the US Weather Bureau do the same for Atlantic storms. But
      the Weather Bureau resisted, insisting that to be taken seriously, they
      should refer to hurricanes using technical jargon rather than names. But
      1950 saw three Atlantic tropical storms simultaneously, which led to
      confusion and spurred Grady Norton (then chief forecaster at what would
      become the National Hurricane Center) to begin using names publicly. After
      that, the cat was out of the bag, and by 1952 the Weather Bureau
      officially adopted a list of women’s names for Atlantic hurricanes that
      would be reused each year. After the practice of retiring hurricanes began
      in 1955, about one name was retired each year and replaced with a new one,
      though some years saw no retirements, and some saw several.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time, there was some grumbling about the use of women’s names (both
      from those that found it offensive to women and those that thought it made
      hurricanes seem frivolous), but the new practice was generally well
      received from the public. In 1969 the National Organization of Women
      called on the National Hurricane Center to discontinue using solely
      women’s names for hurricanes, but the motion went largely ignored. It
      wasn’t until 1978 that Secretary of Commerce Juanita Kreps (the first
      female Secretary of Commerce) ordered NOAA to cease using exclusively
      female names for hurricanes. Following the directive, NOAA convened a
      meeting and amended the hurricane name lists to include names from both
      sexes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the years from 1950 to 1978, hurricane naming evolved significantly.
      There were many inconsistencies early on, such as names being removed from
      circulation, but not “retired” due to severity, merely removed with no
      justification given. Eventually multiple lists were introduced, so that
      names would repeat every two, or four, or five years, until 1978, when our
      modern system was introduced. Since 1978, we have used six lists of
      hurricane names, based on names of both sexes, and including names of
      French and Spanish origin, since these hurricanes affect regions where
      these languages are native. The name lists are cycled, so that names
      repeat every six years, except when a name is retired due to severe damage
      or a large number of casualties.

      These retired hurricanes represent the most severe storms the Atlantic has
      experienced over the last 70 years. The most costly storm to date was
      hurricane Katrina (2005), which caused more than $160 billion dollars in
      damage (adjusted for inflation), mostly due to flooding. Hurricane Mitch
      (1998) was by far the most deadly, with 11,000 casualties. Below you can
      explore and compare the history and resulting damage of all retired
      hurricanes.

    <h3>The characteristics of a retired hurricane</h3>
    <p>
      The characteristics of a retired hurricane are varied. Some are retired
      for the huge damage they cause, others for their number of casualties, and
      those rare few that are pure death and destruction, causing both massive
      damage and many deaths.
    </p>
    <img
      class="desc-img"
      src="static/quadrants_plot_final.png"
      alt="A scatter plot of hurricane damage versus deaths"
    />
    <p>
      There are many factors that predict these types of hurricanes. An obvious
      one is wind speed. Indeed many retired hurricanes reach high wind speeds,
      and the average wind speed of retired hurricanes is greater than normal
      hurricanes. However, there are several examples of retired hurricanes that
      are only category 1 or 2, or never even make it beyond the designation of
      Tropical Storm.
    </p>
    <!-- <img
      class="full-img"
      src="static/wind_speed_final.png"
      alt="Plots of hurricane damage and deaths versus wind speed"
    /> -->
    <p>
      Another major factor predicting hurricane damage and death is the location
      of landfall. Several of the most damaging hurricanes—such as Katrina,
      Harvey, and Sandy—hit major metro areas (New Orleans, Houston, New York
      City). And several of the most deadly hurricanes—Mitch, Maria, Fifi—hit
      areas with less developed infrastructure for weathering and recovering
      from a major hurricane. Of course, the handling of hurricane recovery has
      a major impact on how many deaths result. Hurricane Katrina and Maria are
      notable for their botched responses from the Bush and Trump
      administrations respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although deaths have decreased in recent years due to better forecasts and
      early warning systems, the amount of damage has increased primarily due to
      rising coastal populations and infrastructure cost. According to NOAA,
      climate change is predicted to increase the overall global intensity of
      hurricanes, with more category 4 and 5 hurricanes as well as more rapid
      hurricane strengthening. The amount of coastal flooding from hurricanes is
      also predicted to increase, both due to more rainfall and sea level rise.
      Of course, hurricane seasons are influenced by many factors, so
      year-by-year patterns may seem erratic, but all of this adds up to a
      future with more intense, and likely more retired hurricanes.

    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>
      Information on retired hurricanes, such as deaths, damage, wind speed,
      etc. was recorded by hand and collected from Wikipedia and news reports.
      All data on damage cost was corrected for inflation. No data was found on
      damage for hurricane Anita, so an estimate was made based on a similar
      storm (hurricane Janet). Data on hurricane severity in each region was
      recorded by hand using NOAA’s hurricane database. In several cases, these
      severity designations involved subjective judgements, such as whether a
      hurricane made landfall when it was off the coast of an area, or what
      category a hurricane was when its wind speed changed rapidly upon
      landfall. Geographic data on hurricane tracks was gathered from the
      IBTRACS dataset.
